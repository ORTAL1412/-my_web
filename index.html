      <h3>nail studio</h3>
      <p>
        Welcome to my Nail Spa! Quality of work is no longer a competitive advantage; it is expected.</br>
        What really puts us above the rest is the way you will be treated.</br>
        You become a member of our extended family as soon as you walk through our door. It's simple.</br>
        I treat my staff like family, so they will care for you like family.</br>
        Come and experience the difference for yourself.
        Gel polish is a long-lasting variety of nail polish made up of a type of methacrylate polymer.</br>
        It is painted on the nail similar to traditional nail polish, but does not dry. </br>
        Instead it is cured under an ultraviolet lamp or ultraviolet LED. While regular nail polish formulas</br>
        typically last two to seven days without chipping, gel polish can last as long as two weeks with proper </br>
        application and home care. Gel polish can be more difficult to remove than regular nail polish. </br>
        It is usually removed by soaking the nails in pure acetone</br>
        (the solvent used in most nail polish removers) for five to fifteen minutes, depending on the formula.</br></p>
